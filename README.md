## Purpose
This API is written in JavaScript (Nodejs) and is designed to serve a closed forum specifically for EhB students. The platform allows students to ask questions, and teachers can respond and engage in discussions through comments.

## Quick Start
To get the API up and running, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory.
2. Run the following command to build and start the Docker containers:
    ```
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
3. Once the Docker containers are up and running, you can access the API at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

## Testing
To run all the tests, use the following command:
    ```
    docker-compose -f .\docker-compose-test.yml up
    ```
